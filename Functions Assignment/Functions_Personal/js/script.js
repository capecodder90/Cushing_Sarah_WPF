var paycheck = Number(prompt("How much was this week's paycheck for?")); // declares paycheck, prompt the user for the paycheck amount, store the value as a number
var inTheBank = Number(prompt("How much money in in the checking account?")); // declares inTheBank, prompt the user for the amount in their checking account, store the value as a number
var priceOfJeans = 42; // declares priceOfJeans, defines it as $42
var numOfJeans = howManyJeans(paycheck, inTheBank, priceOfJeans); // declares numOfJeans, sets it equal to the value returned from the function howManyJeans

// creates howManyJeans function with the parameters paycheck, inTheBank and priceOfJeans
